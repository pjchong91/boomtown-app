## Description and Objective:

- For the Boomtown project, the goal was to create a multi-view, fullstack application using PostgresQL as the database, Apollo-Express as the server, and React for the presentation layer.
- The Boomtown project is built from using "Boomtown Starter @ https://github.com/redacademy/boomtown-starter" as a base
- Boomtown is an item sharing platform

- Backend

  - PostgresQL (Postico for GUI)
  - Node.Js
  - Express
  - Apollo
  - GraphQL

- Frontend
  - React (Router, Final Form)
  - Redux
  - Material UI

## Set Up

1. Make a postgres database with the appropriate tables
   TODO: Include a mockup or screenshot of tables
1. Download the repo and run NPM install from both client and server directories
1. Run 'npm start' for the client and server

## Goals for Future Improvement:

- Retrieve error from failed login and display feedback
- Implement borrowing functionalities
- Selectively render certain things on specific pages only - for example 'Share Items' button should not appear on the 'Share' page
